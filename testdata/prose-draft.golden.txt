The Mariner 9 mission was a landmark achievement in planetary science. Arriving at Mars in 1971, it was the first spacecraft to orbit another planet.

The probe vastly exceeded expectations. Its primary objective was to map 70% of the Martian surface. It also studied the planet's two moons, Phobos and Deimos, in unprecedented detail.
